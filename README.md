- Infrastructure Deployment: Creates VPC, EC2, security groups

- Ansible Setup: Installs required dependencies

- Application Deployment: Deploys Docker containers

- Verification: Checks service health


## Access URLs

After deployment, access the services at:

## Service	                                      URL	                                            Default Credentials

- WordPress	               ---             http://your-elastic-ip/	                ---               Setup during first access

- Grafana	                 ---          http://your-elastic-ip:3000                 ---                        admin / admin123

- Prometheus	             ---          http://your-elastic-ip:9090	                ---                       None

- Caddy Admin	             ---          http://your-elastic-ip:2019	                ---                         None



## To get the Elastic IP:

- cd terraform
- terraform output public_ip




## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions

## Challenge 1: Terraform State Management

    - Problem: Terraform state file stored locally, not suitable for team collaboration

    - Solution: Implemented S3 backend with encryption for remote state storage

    - Technical Details: Configured S3 bucket with versioning and server-side encryption


## Challenge 2: CI/CD Pipeline Reliability

    - Problem: GitHub Actions workflow failing due to timing issues and dependencies

    - Solution: Added proper waiting mechanisms and dependency management

    - Technical Details: Implemented SSH connection retries and service health checks


## Challenge 3: Docker Permission Issues

    - Problem: Non-root user unable to run Docker commands without sudo

    - Solution: Automated user addition to docker group in Ansible playbook

    - Technical Details: Used usermod command and proper group management


## Challenge 4: Service Discovery

    - Problem: Containers unable to communicate due to network issues

    - Solution: Implemented Docker custom network and proper service naming

    - Technical Details: Created monitor-net bridge network with DNS resolution


## Challenge 5: Resource Optimization

    - Problem: Memory and CPU overallocation on EC2 instance

    - Solution: Right-sized instance type and implemented resource limits

    - Technical Details: Selected t3.medium with burstable CPU credits


## Challenge 6: Security Hardening

    - Problem: Excessive port exposure and insecure defaults

    - Solution: Minimal port exposure and secure configuration practices

    - Technical Details: Security group with least privilege principles




## Technical Decisions

- Terraform: Declarative, modular, provider ecosystem

- Ansible: Agentless, idempotent, readable YAML

- Docker Compose: Simplified orchestration, local dev friendly

- Stack Benefits: Cost-effective, scalable, maintainable, observable



##  Skills Demonstrated

## DevOps Practices

- DevOps: Terraform, Ansible, Docker Compose, CI/CD

- Cloud: AWS EC2, VPC, Security Groups, S3

- Technical: Bash, YAML, Linux, Docker, Networking

- Soft: Problem-solving, documentation, architecture, troubleshooting




## Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

1. SSH Connection Failed

   - Verify the SSH key is named "yourkeypairname" in AWS

   - Check security group allows SSH (port 22)


2. Terraform Errors

   - Ensure AWS credentials are properly configured

   - Verify S3 bucket name is unique


3. Docker Containers Not Starting

   - Check disk space on EC2 instance

   - Verify Docker daemon is running


5. Services Not Accessible

   - Check security group rules

   -mVerify containers are running: docker ps



## Logs Inspection

# Docker logs

- ssh -i ~/.ssh/keypairname.pem ec2-user@${SERVER_IP} "docker logs <container_name>"


# System logs
